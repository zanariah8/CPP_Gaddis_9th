/* Cyborg Data Type Sizes
 * 
 * You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order
 * to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following
 * data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any technical
 * documentation, so you can't look that information up. Write a C++ program that
 * will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the information on screen.
